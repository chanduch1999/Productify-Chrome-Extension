### Application and Scope:
Productify is great for general users but not limited to them! Productify can be used in offices and institutions to measure the productivity of employees and more. This can be achieved by modifying the criteria for measuring productivity. Feedback can be taken from users when they first install the extension, taking into consideration their areas of interest and setting up tags for the same. Moreover, users will be asked to review their browsing history every day and tick out sites that they found useful. Over time, we would have a good idea as to what the user finds to be productive and provide suggestions based on the same.
